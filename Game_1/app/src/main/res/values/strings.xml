    <string name="prologue">
        It is an era of mythical times, and power struggles within great sects in nations while you, Xio Dan are living in a remote peaceful village along with your friends and your best friend Yan Hong. As kids who barely turned 10, you and your friends are playing in the village fields to your hearts content. After a long day of joy, you and your friends bid goodbyes and scattered to your homes.

The next thing you know, you awaken in the village shrine beside your friend Yan.
